  THE NO. OF CURRENTLY ACTIVE GRID POINTS IS        20011

 THE POPULATION VALUES FOR [C0,C1,C2,C3] FOR EACH OF 
 THE  1 OUTPUT EQUATION(S), ARE SHOWN BELOW:

 YOU HAVE CHOSEN TO MODEL THE ASSAY ERROR FUNCTION,
 S.D. AS FOLLOWS (ASSUMING SD1 = C0+C1*Y+C2*Y**2+C3*Y**3):

 S.D. = GAMMA*SD1, WITH GAMMA TO BE ESTIMATED, AND
                  THE INITIAL GAMMA ESTIMATE TO BE  5.000000000

 THE STARTING CYCLE NO. FOR THIS RUN IS      1

 THE LAST CYCLE NO. WILL BE .LE.    100


 BUT THE ANALYSIS WILL STOP BEFORE THE MAX. NO. OF
 CYCLES HAVE BEEN RUN IF CONVERGENCE IS ACHIEVED, AND
 CONVERGENCE IS ACHIEVED BASED ON LOGIC AND PRE-SET TOLERANCE
 PARAMETERS WHICH ARE APPROPRIATE FOR THE "INTERIOR POINT 
 ALGORITHM" USED BY THIS PROGRAM. THIS ALGORITM WAS DEVELOPED
 BY JIM BURKE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON, AND ADAPTED FOR
 THIS PROGRAM BY BOB LEARY.

 THE CYCLE TOL. PARAMETER SET BY THE USER IS  0.01000000000000000
 FOR CONVERGENCE, THE LOG-LIK BETWEEN 2 CONSECUTIVE "MAJOR CYCLES"
 MUST BE .LE. THIS VALUE.

 THE TOLERANCE PARAMETER USED BY THE DIFFERENTIAL
 EQUATION SOLVER (VODE), IS: 
   1.0000000000000000E-004

 THE APRIORI JOINT DENSITY IS UNIFORM.

 THE FOLLOWING  4 SETS OF LINES GIVE ADDITIONAL
 STATISTICS FOR THE VARIABLES. FOR EACH SET:

 THE 1ST LINE GIVES THE MODE, THE SKEWNESS, THE KURTOSIS, AND 
 THE 2.5 %-TILE VALUE OF THE DISTRIBUTION. 

 THE 2ND LINE GIVES THE 25, 50, 75, AND 97.5 %-TILE VALUES OF 
 THE DISTRIBUTION. 

 THE 3RD LINE GIVES THREE ADDITIONAL AD-HOC ESTIMATES OF THE 
 STANDARD DEVIATION FOR THAT MARGINAL DENSITY. THE 1ST S.D. 
 ESTIMATE IS THE STANDARD DEVIATION OF A NORMAL DISTRIBUTION 
 HAVING THE SAME [25, 75] %-TILE RANGE AS THAT VARIABLE. THE
 2ND ESTIMATE IS THE STANDARD DEVIATION OF A NORMAL DIST.
 HAVING THE SAME [2.5, 97.5] %-TILE RANGE AS THAT VARIABLE. THE
 3RD ESTIMATE IS THE AVERAGE OF THE FIRST TWO. THE 4TH VALUE
 IN THE LINE IS THE THE % SCALED INFO FOR THAT MARGINAL DENS.
